# Paladins Java API

Simple and up-to-date java wrapper for [HiRez' Paladins REST-API](https://www.paladins.com/).

**Note:** If any changes from the api are not already implemented into this wrapper, please let me know through
an [issue](/issues), [mail](mailto://admin@koboo.eu) or [pull-request](/pulls).

(updated fork of HeyZeer0's [Paladins-Java-API](https://github.com/HeyZeer0/Paladins-Java-API))
